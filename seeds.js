        title: "Snap in Historical Context", 
        body: "As Snap prepares for its IPO, the company is taking heat for a rumored decision to issue non-voting shares, leaving founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy with 70% of the company\u2019s voting power. The decision has irked some investors, who believe that Snap is abusing a position of power to take away rights that investors deserve. Based on historical precedents, though, a consolidation of power may be the best way to protect against shareholders Fwho often hold a short-term mindset that can inhibit innovation.<br><br>The Snap IPO would not mark the first time that recent tech entrepreneurs have ensured their own autonomy. Last June, Facebook\u2019s board, which is more than 50% controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, approved a stock split in which shareholders received two additional non-voting shares for each voting share owned. The move allowed Zuckerberg room to maneuver and to sell his shares without diluting his voting position. \n Facebook has been wildly successful under Zuckerberg\u2019s reign, with the stock having risen 343% since the beginning of 2013. In ensuring their continued control over their companies, Spiegel and Zuckerberg could be showing that they have learned from entrepreneurs before them who struggled while subject to the control of shareholders.<br><br>Perhaps the best example of this was the most forward-thinking CEO the world has ever known, Steve Jobs. When Apple was taken public in 1981, Jobs and the Apple Board decided that the company should be run by a more traditional leader and hired John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola, with Jobs taking over as head of the Macintosh team. There, Jobs created an astonishing product but failed to hit short-term sales targets. Tensions rose, and Jobs was removed from the position and effectively forced out of Apple in 1985.<br><br>By 1997, Apple had only 4% market share in the PC market and was losing over $1Bn annually, and it realized that it needed to turn back to Jobs. Jobs had learned his lesson, and made it clear that he required a mandate to make massive changes to the company. In the coming years, he revolutionized Apple, focusing on vertical integration and designing groundbreaking new products such as the iMac, iPod, and iPhone. Apple has since grown from a$3Bn valuation in 1997 to a present day value over $600Bn. The company\u2019s share price fell 10% when Jobs announced he was taking medical leave in January 2009.<br><br>More recently, the return of Michael Dell as CEO of Dell in the 2000s provides another example of a leader unable to innovate while subject to a Board\u2019s demands. In 2007, Dell faced shrinking sales and margins in a personal computer market that was competitive and slow-growing. Michael tried to shift the company\u2019s focus away from personal computers and primarily towards servers and software. He acquired Perot Systems in 2009 and Quest Software in 2012, but was unable to shift the primary focus of the company. The shareholders had bought a PC business, and they seemed ready to go down with the ship if that business failed.<br><br>On October 30, 2013, Michael Dell, backed by private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, regained control of the company through a private buyout. The company has been able to transform since, both by creating new lines of personal and business computers and by expanding into new industries. Most notably, Dell acquired EMC Corporation, a massive software and data storage company, for a tech record $67 billion in September 2016.  Only time will tell how successful Dell\u2019s transformation can be, but it is evident that its founder\u2019s ability to break free from shareholders\u2019 control was pivotal in enabling the company to move forward.<br><br>There are benefits and drawbacks to entrusting great power to a founder. At the end of the day, though, investors hoping to see Snap remain a groundbreaking company that can adapt and grow over time could do a lot worse than putting their trust in someone like Spiegel.",

        body: 'One start-up that particularly caught my attention this week was <strong><a href="http://www.hurdl.com/"">HURDL Enterprises<\/strong><\/a>, maker of a wearable technology designed for large live events. Hurdl\u2019s product is an LED wristband that is activated via SMS message and worn by attendees at an event or concert. The color of the wristband is manipulated through radio waves that can be controlled by the concert light operator. The color of the wristband can be changed to reflect characteristics of the audience, such as gender, hometown, or relationship status (the operator could, for example, light up all single women in the crowd). This allows the Hurdl organizers of concerts to gather data which can then be used in marketing. After the concert, attendees receive two personalized advertisements, whether for music downloads, t-shirts, or something else entirely. Of course, concert-goers must actually participate in the exercise, and the excitement of Hurdl\u2019s light displays has drawn participation rates between 85 and 90%. As the music industry seeks to adjust in an era where CD sales are declining, making concerts and branding more important, Hurdl has produced an ingenious product to provide data and targeted advertisements at concerts in a brand new way. The product appeared at the Country Music Awards in November, and is sure to reappear in many new venues in the future. <br><br><strong>Tuesday\u2019s AppDynamics sale to Cisco this week<\/strong> was a case study of a tech landscape in which acquisitions by large tech companies are increasingly the most lucrative exit opportunity for successful software start-ups. Cisco paid $3.7Bn in the acquisition, more than twice the amount that the company was expected to be valued at in its IPO- the top estimates for the IPO were in the range of $1.7Bn. While AppDynamics, a software companies that helps companies to identify issues with their digital applications, had\r\nacquired a number of patents and grown impressive revenue, it was not yet cash flow positive and faced competition from similar startups as well as tech giants like Microsoft. Had the company proceeded to IPO, a price below $2Bn would have reflected the uncertainty around the company\u2019s future. When paired with the powerful Cisco, the company\u2019s path forward becomes much smoother as its team gains access to immense resources.  At the same time, Cisco gains the opportunity to utilize the patents, proprietary software, and brainpower of AppDynamics across its company, as well as to integrate the product into its existing digital infrastructure offerings. <a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajVC/status/824082326921641985">Over $51Bn flowed into cloud strategic M&A in 2016<\/a>, up from $10Bn in 2015, and all indications are that this trend is likely to continue through 2017 and beyond.',

        title: "On Uber and Growth at All Costs",
        body: "While valuations of leading consumer tech companies have taken off in recent years, profitability in many cases has not. Tech competition around the globe continues to heat up, and companies are burning cash more quickly than ever to gain market share. Investors have seemingly found consensus that there are brighter days ahead, but the reality of the situation is a bit less clear.<br><br>Uber is arguably the clearest example of this phenomenon. On January 19, Uber received investment from SoftBank at a blended valuation of $54Bn. Per its <a href='https://www.wsj.com/graphics/uber-financials/'>financials published in the WSJ<\/a>, the company had net income of $-1.5bn in Q3 2017, with revenues of $2.0bn. Facing heavy competition in the US (Lyft, Via, Juno) and abroad (Didi Chuxing, Grab, Ola), the company remains mired in an expensive land grab for market share, and it is burning billions to stay on top.<br><br>The accepted wisdom in Silicon Valley is that growth should be attained at all costs: acquire users now, figure profitability out later. Many look at today\u2019s land grab and see a light at the end of the tunnel, concluding that Uber will soon emerge as a powerful cash-generating force. For a few reasons, I would be cautious in making this conclusion: <ol><li>Consumers are fickle: If Lyft is ten cents cheaper than Uber, consumers take Lyft. If an upstart competitor offers free rides, consumers download their app. On the supply side, the song remains the same; drivers will drive for whichever company will pay them more. This makes the lifetime value of customers being acquired a tricky concept.<\/li><li>Innovation is accelerating: A few years ago, ride-sharing apps were transformative; today they\u2019re almost commoditized. Self-driving cars will soon transform the scene, and futuristic companies like <a href='https://www.boringcompany.com/'>The Boring Company<\/a> could do the same. I highly recommend against asking a blockchain junkie about the future of transportation, but if you\u2019re into that kind of thing you\u2019ll hear an even bleaker outlook for Uber. No one can say with any certainty how we\u2019ll get from A to B ten years from now, so it feels naive to assume that Uber will be safely printing cash then.<\/li><li>Funds are growing: More cash to invest means more cash to burn, and today there is more cash to invest than ever. NEA raised a $3.3Bn fund in 2017; Sequoia is targeting over $5Bn for its next fund; SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund manages near $100Bn. (SoftBank, in fact, has already <a href='https://qz.com/1187144/softbank-not-uber-is-the-real-king-of-ride-hailing/'>made big bets on 4 ride-hailing startups<\/a>.) The money fueling today\u2019s growth is not drying up any time soon, and if Uber stops burning cash, a competitor will surely be ready to burn twice as much to catch up.<\/li><\/ol> Ultimately, after billions in spending, Uber finds itself in a precarious position. If the company prioritizes profitability, it could pay dearly in future growth. If it continues to prioritize growth, it may be a long long way from profitability. <br><br>There are certainly reasons to believe Uber will conquer the above hurdles. Its algorithms are getting smarter, its brand is getting bigger, and it has its sights on profitability <a href='https://www.bnn.ca/uber-to-be-profitable-within-3-years-ceo-1.976083'>in the next couple of years<\/a>. It has made heavy (<a href='https://www.wired.com/story/uber-waymo-google-levandowski-lawsuit-stroz-report/'>if dishonest<\/a>) investments into self-driving cars, has diversified into food delivery with Uber Eats, and looks to stay on the leading edge of transportation. For today, though, there remain many questions and an interesting road ahead.",

Simple voice commands- the word \u201cgo\u201d represents the majority of commands a user will use- are used to choose stories. An impressive number of sources are available, including sections like business, politics, and sports from most top news providers.<br><br>As a standalone phone app, Voicecaster is only moderately promising. While I appreciated that it could read me news stories on my walk to work, I wasn\u2019t sold on the touch-free navigation. It was hard to envision scenarios in which I had my phone close enough to speak directly into it, yet was unable to interact with it through touch.<br><br>That\u2019s where integration into other platform comes in. With innovations like Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot and Google Home, new far-field microphone technology has become mainstream. Siri never took off, and a large reason is because if you\u2019re already holding your phone up to your face, you might as well use the screen. Today, there are popular technologies that allow you to comfortably use voice commands from anywhere nearby. I could easily see my mom asking Alexa to run through the top news stories while cooking breakfast and my dad catching up on sports news via his car on the way to work.<br><br>A further note on news in the car: it is surprising to me that, as far as car and music technologies have come, local stations and NPR remain popular. As the world becomes more connected, people will surely settle for stations like NPR less and turn instead to some technology similar to Voicecaster for news while driving. Voicecaster could aim to build a killer application for cars, or to partner with an existing in-car technology, to try to win this market before a competitor does.<br><br>In their presentation, the founding team mentioned a number of possible future paths including integrating into high-tech systems, partnering with subscription-based news sources, placing audio ads, and utilizing its voice command system for other phone apps (e.g. Yelp). Integrating into another system is a manageable route with the highest upside, and Voicecaster has the opportunity to really take off if it can find the right partner.",

While people love being able to run errands with their dog, a lot of stores don\u2019t allow dogs inside, including stores that sell food and legally cannot allow pets. Dog Parker solves this issue by running high-tech \u201cdog houses\u201d around an area of focus where the owner can safely and comfortably leave their dogs while they complete their chore inside. The company was founded by Chelsea Brownridge, previously co-founder of a bootcamp for millennial social innovators, and Todd Schechter, similarly a past founder of an eight week workshop for social entrepreneurs.<br><br>The company\u2019s dog houses themselves are impressive and well-refined. The crate is designed by Boyce Technologies in Long Island City, the same innovative manufacturing and digital security company that creates all of the MTA\u2019s help points city-wide. The dog house comes complete with temperature control, a comfortable and spacious bed, and even a webcam that allows users to monitor their dogs while away. The security of the houses is impressive as well, as each is capable of being unlocked by RFID, a phone app, a Dog Parker remote operator, or a physical keypad and lock stored in the back of the house.<br><br>From a business perspective, the company has completed it trial stage and is expecting growth to take off. The trial was done in Brooklyn with three dog houses at nine locations, and over 100 dog owners. Pleased with the results, the company has raised $1.2M and will move forward quickly, installing 100 dog houses throughout Brooklyn. At the Tech Meetup, Chelsea revealed that the company had raised 2/3 of its goal for the next round of fundraising and was looking to hire a head of product, director of marketing, and sales manager, all signs that the company is moving full-steam ahead into the next phase of growth.<br><br>Currently, the company is charging a fee of $25 per year, plus 20 cents per minute while using a dog house. In order to incentivize stores to host dog houses in the trial period, the company offered a percentage of revenue. As the company gains recognition in the future, it will have power to negotiate more favorable deals with stores and will be able to fine-tune its pricing model.<br><br>I look forward to following Dog Parker as it is sure to be successful in signing up a large number of new members in Brooklyn. Potential customers will be abundant in wealthy residential neighborhoods, especially at the low entry price of $25. There will certainly be challenges to growing at the exponential rate targeted, including efficiently expanding operating areas and conducting maintenance on the dog houses, but Dog Parker seems excited and ready for the challenge, and the payoff could be immense.",

While the messages last a bit longer than on Snapchat (24 hours), the feel is very much the same. There\u2019s little in the way of new technology- voice messaging is already possible through iMessage, FaceBook, and WhatsApp- but the app\u2019s modern, minimalist interface and fun filters have a familiar appeal to the younger crowd.<br><br>At the time of the Tech Meetup, Pundit had already raised a seed round of $120,000 through the Disney TechStars program, a ten-week accelerator in which they participated. Interestingly, this investment also resulted in the potential to partner with Disney moving forward. While Chris told me that Disney is extremely protective of its classic content (e.g. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck), he said that there were talks of featuring current movies in the future for voice enhancements, using Moana as an example. The right Disney movies would provide Pundit with added legitimacy to its young user base and could keep the app fresh and differentiated.<br><br>Ultimately, I think Pundit\u2019s success will lie in whether or not it is able to break into certain younger demographics in a meaningful way. Its voice messages can be sent to other platforms, including iMessage, but I see this as little more than a marketing tool to get more downloads. For people to consistently want to use the app, friend groups will need to enjoy it in isolation from other apps. A voice synthesizer is neat, but not enough to warrant a download. A separated, aesthetically pleasing environment in which to have fun with friends over voice messaging should be. If Pundit is able to market to the right groups and approach critical mass, it could be on to something.<br><br><em>Update: Pundit has since become a \u201csticker messenger\u201d that looks absolutely awful.<\/em>",

The to-do list conveniently follows the user around the internet as a reminder, and micropayments made through Contributor make the idea sustainable ($5-10 per month was the estimate given). Unfortunately, Contributor is briefly unavailable until its new update is released.<br><br>The second hack was <a href='http://dataselfie.it/#/'>DataSelfie<\/a>, a Chrome extension allowing users to see what data the internet is tracking about them. The extension collects Facebook activity and sends it to IBM Watson for analysis, and its resulting mapping of activity, personality, and ad targeting was an interesting and useful graphic. While the creators viewed the project as a tech hobby rather than a product,  something similar could prove to be a hit with internet users who are curious about how the internet really gets to know them.<br><br><em>Note: DataSelfie exposed me to some of the complexities of what the internet learns about you, and it\u2019s quite impressive. <a href='https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win'>This article<\/a> does a great job telling the story of how psychoanalysis and big data have come together to provide an incredible mapping of people\u2019s interests: <br><br>\u201cIn 2012, Kosinski proved that on the basis of an average of 68 Facebook \u201clikes\u201d by a user, it was possible to predict their skin color (with 95 percent accuracy), their sexual orientation (88 percent accuracy), and their affiliation to the Democratic or Republican party (85 percent). But it didn\u2019t stop there. Intelligence, religious affiliation, as well as alcohol, cigarette and drug use, could all be determined. From the data it was even possible to deduce whether someone\u2019s parents were divorced.\u201d<\/em><br><h3>VirtualApt<\/h3><br>The one true start-up that I found particularly interesting at the event was <a href='https://virtualapt.com/'>VirtualApt<\/a>. The company licenses out supercomputers equipped with high definition 3D cameras that have the ability to completely analyze their surrounding environment and produce videos in minutes. The technology was initially intended to make promotional videos for real estate companies, but the company has expanded to serve other companies, such as gyms and small stores.<br><br>It will be interesting to see, as virtual reality and 3D imagery catch on, what other applications will become popular. One member of the audience asked if the robot could be choreographed to film a live dance performance. Other applications could include live sports events and nature experiences (Planet Earth 3?). The technology is currently limited by the high costs of producing the supercomputers required. VirtualApt\u2019s robots render 3D imaging in mere minutes, but use $20,000 of computing power to do so. Competitors with lower quality supercomputers can take hours or days to produce the same product.<br><h3>One Last Thing<\/h3><br>I was struck by how energized the tech community has become politically. The first 10-15 minutes were dominated by condemnations of some of Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial policies, including the immigration order and the choice of former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai as FCC chairman. Speakers urged the audience to get involved, and some of the political remarks made were met with the loudest applause of the night. It was certainly cool to see how willing the tech community is to stand for what it believes in.",

In 2012, Founder and Managing Partner Jonathan Lehr was working at Morgan Stanley where he evaluated enterprise technologies in the office of the CIO.
