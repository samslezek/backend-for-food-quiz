	 <h1>About Me</h1>

	<img style='width:200px' src='https://i.imgur.com/GtpN14A.jpg'></img>

	 <p><br>I'm Sam Slezek, a Duke Computer Science and Economics graduate working in venture capital in San Francisco. I grew up on the farms of Hatfield, MA where I picked tobacco, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. I've long been interested in building disruptive technology companies, and spend my days learning about how this is done by the best in the world. <br></p>

	 <h3>A bit on my past and current roles:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>While at Duke, I spent my three summers on separate adventures: a 10-week service trip in Nicaragua, a software development internship for a small startup in the electric vehicle space, and an internship on the Acquisition Finance desk at Morgan Stanley in New York.</li><br>

	<li>After graduation, I joined the Fixed Income Capital Markets team at Morgan Stanley serving Financial Institutions, primarily in life and P&C insurance. I built out several group processes and models and worked on numerous large debt and hybrid deals for clients including Allstate, Aflac, Progressive, and Old Republic.</li> <br>

	<li>In early 2017 I joined venture capital firm <a href="http://www.amasia.vc">Amasia</a> in 2017 as the firm's first full-time associate. At Amasia, I've transformed firm processes including outbound sourcing, financial modeling, fundraising, portfolio support, and quarterly reporting. I have also sourced deals in Beeswax (Amasia co-led $15m Series B alongside Foundry Group and RRE Ventures) and Enwoven (Amasia led $500k seed extension), and played a central role in diligence of Xendit (Amasia co-led $18m Series A alongside Kleiner Perkins), Skillshare (follow-on investment in $20m Series C, led by Union Square Ventures), and Ampogee (small seed deal).</li> </ul></p>

	 <h3>A few of my interests:</h3>
	 <ul>
	 <li><strong>What I do for fun:</strong> Outside of work, I love to do be competitive however possible. I still haven't quite recovered from my dream of being an NBA player and play basketball 5+ times per week, including in a rec league at UCSF every Thursday. I also play my fair share of soccer, football, golf, poker, and League of Legends.</li><br>
	 <li><strong>What I'm listening to:</strong> I try not to miss any podcasts from Exponent (by Ben Thompson, writer of Stratechery) or Bill Simmons Podcast. I listen to all kinds of music (classic rock, hip hop, EDM, country); my favorite band is hands down <a href="http://www.milksf.com/shows/pineaple-jones-new-lovers-milk-bar-presents">Pineapple Jones and The New Lovers</a>, possibly biased by the fact that they're my roommates and I get to jam with them. </li><br>
	 <li><strong>What I'm Reading:</strong> As a VC, I'm inundated with numerous newsletters that I read daily; Stratechery is the best, though Fortune Term Sheet is a necessity. Online, I like to read <a href='www.theathletic.com'>The Athletic</a>, a site for high-quality sports news from writers close to the teams. The last book I finished was Measure What Matters by John Doerr, and I'm currently reading Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson.</li><br>
